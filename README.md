Movie Recommendation System
This project is divided into two main parts: the Machine Learning part and the Web Application part.

Part 1: Machine Learning
In the initial part of this project, a machine learning model was trained to create a recommendation system. The implementation involves:

Training the model using a dataset of movies.
Creating a similarity matrix and a pickle file from the dataset. These files are essential for the recommendation functionality in the web application.
To get started:

Download the complete code.
Set the path for your dataset, or use your own dataset.
Generate the similarity matrix and the pickle file for the dataset.
Part 2: Web Application
The second part of the project involves creating a web application with user login and registration functionality. The application allows users to:

Create an account and log in.
Select a movie, after which the model recommends 5 similar movies.
Add TV shows to their list.
Save TV shows and delete them if desired.
To get started with the web application:

Set the directory for the initial dataset, the pickle file, and the similarity matrix.
